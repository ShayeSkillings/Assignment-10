        <strong>Brown Trout</strong> in Montana are freshwater fish known for their olive-green, brownish, and bright yellow coloring, scattered with black and sometimes reddish spots. They typically range from 12 to 20 inches, but can grow larger. They prefer cool, well-oxygenated waters in rivers, streams, lakes, and reservoirs, often seeking refuge in rocky areas. Opportunistic feeders, they eat insects, small fish, and terrestrial insects. Conservation efforts focus on maintaining healthy populations through catch-and-release practices and habitat restoration. As an angler, these are quite the prize, as they are a challenge to catch. I caught this brown trout on the Blackfoot River.

    <strong>Bull Trout[c]</strong> in Montana are characterized by their olive-green to blue-gray back and sides, often with light spots scattered across their body. They have pale, creamy spots on their dark background, with a distinct white leading edge on their lower fins. These trout typically grow larger than other trout species, with adults often exceeding 20 inches in length. Bull trout prefer cold, clear waters of streams, rivers, and lakes, particularly in mountainous regions with abundant cover such as large rocks, logs, and deep pools.
